# Customer Churn Prediction
Churn is a metric of customer satisfaction. Low churn rate means that the customers are happy; and a higer churn rate means that the customers are no longer satisfied with the product/ business model and are leaving the company. This means churn rate can be very important. A small 🔽 in the churn rate can mean potentially 🔼 profits for the company.

According to Forbes, it takes a lot more money to acquire a new customer 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 than retaining an old one. Churn tells you how many existing customers are leaving your business, so lowering churn has a big positive impact on your revenue streams 💰.

Churn is a good indicator of growth potential. Churn rates track lost customers, and growth rates track new customers—comparing and analyzing both of these metrics tells you exactly how much your business is growing over time. If growth is higher than churn, you can say your business is growing 😊. If churn is higher than growth, your business is getting smaller 😢.

# How to run the notebook?

It is quiet simple, if you are using `Anaconda` then what you want to do is create a new environment using:

```Bash
conda create -n new_env_name
```

After this activate your newly created by:

```Bash
conda activate new_env_name
```

After activating the environment, do this. this will install all dependencies that are require to run the notebook.

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run the jupyter notebook and create the model for churn prediction ✔. The data is already bundeled with the repo, so you can use the same data if you want or if you find some other dataset, you can use that as well.
